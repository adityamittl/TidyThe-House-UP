# Tidy The House Up

## 💡 Inspiration
Cleaning the house and staying organized is much easier with a little help. Tidy The House Up is an easy and gratifying way to keep you motivated while cleaning the house. With this project you can plan your cleaning activities, track progress, and share done tasks with community. For each task completed, you will receive points which can be transformed into rewards at the end of the week.

Make your routine more manageable with tasks that are easy to follow. Share your results with friends and earn rewards at the end of the week.

## 💻 How it Works?
- Users need to Login/Signup
- Every morning when they wake up, they see the list of added rooms
- They need to click the picture of every room and if the room is messy, the ML model will mark it as messy otherwise, it will be marked as Clean.
- The messy rooms will be added to the To Clean list.
- Whenever the user will clean that room, he/she has to upload its picture again so that our Model can check that its Monica Clean.
- Users can share their clean room pictures with their friends where they would be rewarded for every room cleaned.
